What is DOM ?

- DOM stands for or is an acronym of Document Object Model.
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is an essential part of web development. 
    It provides a way for programmers to interact with and manipulate the structure of a website.

- It like an Application Progamming Interface for manipulating HTML and XML documents.
- The DOM, or Document Object Model, is like a map of a website. Just like how a map shows you where all the streets and buildings are in a city, 
    the DOM shows you where everything is on a website.
- The DOM helps your computer understand the different parts of a website and how they are put together.
- Just like you can use a map to find your way around a city, programmers can use the DOM to find different parts of a website and change their properties. 
    For example, they can make a button change color when a user hovers over it or make pictures move around on the screen.

- The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

Why to use DOM ?

- With the help of the DOM, developers can access and change the different parts of a webpage. 
This allows them to create dynamic and interactive websites, where user interactions can trigger changes in the page's layout and content.

- So, How does this DOM starts and where does it recides. DOM is created when a page is reloaded meaning the Browser creates a document Object
    model of the web page. Dom is created in a tree like structure called as DOM Tree.


DOM  +  JS
- The DOM and JavaScript are like two friends that work together to make websites cool and interactive. 
- Together, the DOM and JavaScript make the website come alive and respond to what you do, like moving your mouse or clicking on a button.


DOM Structure â€“ Understanding the DOM Tree

- Imagine a website is like a big book, and each page in that book represents a different part of the website. 
The DOM tree is like a table of contents for that book. It shows you all the different parts of the website, and how they are organized.
- Each part of the website is called an "element" and these elements are arranged in a tree-like structure.

- The top of the tree is called the "root" and it represents the entire website. From there, the tree branches out into different sections,
 like the headings, paragraphs, images, and others that make up the entire website.

- Just like how the table of contents in a book helps you find specific pages, the DOM tree helps computers find specific elements on a website.
- In short, the DOM tree represents the structure of a website in a way that computers can understand. Developers can use it to access and manipulate 
 different elements in that structure to create dynamic web pages.

How to Access the DOM

- Accessing elements in the DOM means finding specific parts of a website and changing or manipulating them.
- To access an element on a website, you need to know the specific element you want to access.
- JavaScript provides different methods to access the elements in the DOM, such as getElementById, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll.
- These methods allow you to find an element based on its id, tagname, or classname and select it for manipulation.
- For example, you can access a button on a webpage and change its text or color when a user clicks on it. 

Or, you can access an image on a webpage and change it to a different image when a user hovers over it.

Accessing a DOM method
-HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).
-HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change"hi
